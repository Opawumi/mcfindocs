## 2. Key Accomplishments

### 🎨 UI & Theming
*   **"White Paper" Aesthetic:** Rigorously enforced a clean white background across the entire application to ensure maximum readability and professional appearance.
*   **Green Branding:** Integrated the primary green brand color for actions, highlights, and active states.
*   **Dark Mode Override:** Successfully neutralized system dark mode to prevent UI inconsistencies, ensuring a stable visual experience for all users.
*   **Consistent Navigation:** Implemented a standardized "Back to Dashboard" navigation pattern across all modules.

### 📧 E-Memos Module
A comprehensive system for internal communication and tracking.
*   **Inbox/Sent/Drafts:** Fully structured text-based interfaces for managing correspondence.
*   **Compose Interface:** Detailed form for creating memos with fields for Recipients (To/CC), Subject, Side Notes, Approvers, and Rich Text content.
*   **Tracking & Archives:** Dedicated views for monitoring memo status and accessing historical records.

### 🎥 E-Meetings Module
A central hub for virtual collaboration.
*   **Meeting Hub:** A welcoming landing page featuring "New Meeting" creation and a "Join Code" entry point.
*   **Meeting List:** A clear, tabular view of scheduled and past meetings with search and filtering capabilities.
*   **Sidebar Integration:** Seamless access via the main application sidebar.

### 👥 User Management (Admin)
*   **User Directory:** A tabular view to manage system users, displaying Name, Role, Department, and Status.
*   **Search & Filter:** Real-time filtering to quickly locate users by name or email.
*   **Action Controls:** Dropdown menus for managing individual user accounts (Edit, Deactivate).

### ⚙️ Settings
*   **Tabbed Interface:** Organized settings into Profile, Notifications, Security, and Appearance.

*   **Notification Preferences:** Granular toggles for Email and System alerts.
*   **Dark Mode Policy:** Clearly indicated that Dark Mode is disabled by admin policy to maintain consistency.

### ⚡ Technical Enhancements
*   **Turbopack Migration:** Upgraded the development server from Webpack to **Turbopack**, resulting in significantly faster render times and hot module replacement (HMR).
*   **Modular Architecture:** Refactored code into a feature-based structure (`src/features/memos`, `meetings`, `users`) for better scalability and maintainability.
*   **Component Library:** Expanded the shared UI component library (shadcn/ui) with essential elements like Switches, Tables, and Dropdowns.

## 3. Next Steps & Roadmap
*   **Backend Integration:** Connect frontend forms to real API endpoints for data persistence.
*   **Advanced Search:** Implement global search across Documents, Memos, and Meetings.
*   **Collaborative Editing:** Enable real-time document co-authoring.
