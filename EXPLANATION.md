# What We've Built (Explained for Everyone)

Imagine we are building a **Digital Office Building**. So far, we have built the "Front Desk," the "Hallways," and the "Desks," but we haven't hired the "Filing Clerk" yet (that's the Backend).

Here is what is currently working:

## 🏛️ The Main Building (Dashboard)
We have a central lobby where you can see your recent activity. It’s the "Home Base" where you start your workday.

## ✉️ The Digital Letter System (E-Memos)
This is like a very smart internal mailing system.
*   **The Blueprint (Compose):** We've made a form where you can write letters. You can pick who gets it, who needs to "recommend" it, and who finally "approves" it.
*   **The Tracking Board:** We added a feature where you can see exactly where a letter is. Is it still at the sender's desk? Is the boss looking at it? Has it been signed?
*   **Supervisor's Eye:** We built a special view for Department Heads. They can see all the letters moving in their department to make sure nothing gets stuck.

## 🤝 The Meeting Room (E-Meetings)
A place to organize digital get-togethers. You can see a list of upcoming meetings and join them with a code, just like a private club.

## 🎨 The Look (Design)
We’ve made sure everything looks clean, professional, and is in the official "White and Green" brand colors. It feels like one solid, unified tool.

# What is "The Backend" and why do we need it?

Right now, the project is like a **beautifully decorated model home**. When you type a memo and hit "Send," it "acts" like it was sent, but if you refresh the page, it disappears. 

The **Backend** is the "Memory" and "Brain" of the office. We need it for:

1.  **Saving Data (The Database):** So when you write a memo, it stays there forever until deleted.
2.  **Real People (Users):** So users can actually log in with a password and see only their own messages.
3.  **Real File Creation:** Actually turning those memos into real PDF files that people can download and print.
4.  **Security:** Making sure a regular staff member can't go into the Vice-Chancellor's settings and change things.

## How I can help you with the Backend:
I am ready to help you build this "Brain"! Here is how we can do it:

*   **Step 1: Setup:** I can help you set up a database (like Supabase or Firebase) which is like buying the filing cabinets.
*   **Step 2: Security:** I can write the code for the "Login" screen so people can sign in securely.
*   **Step 3: Connecting the Pipes:** I will "hook up" the forms I built (like the Memo form) to the database so that when you click "Save," it actually saves.
*   **Step 4: Automation:** I can help write the "Robots" that send an email notification to the Boss whenever a new memo is waiting for them.

**Would you like to start setting up the Database/Backend now, or should we polish more of the visual parts first?**
